\section{Conclusions}
We successfully developed a statistical model and methodology for predicting upgrading-risk, and providing risk-based personalized biopsy decisions, in prostate cancer AS. We externally validated our model, covering nearly 73\% patients from the Movember Foundations' GAP3 database. The model made available via a user-friendly web-application (\url{https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/prias_biopsy_recommender/}) enables shared decision making of biopsy schedules by comparing fixed and personalized schedules on total biopsies and expected time delay in detecting upgrading. Novel biomarkers and MRI data can be added as predictors in the model to improve predictions in the future. Recalibration of baseline upgrading-risk is advised for cohorts not validated in this work.
